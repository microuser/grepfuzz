# Lab 2: Architecture Documentation and Enhancements Log


This document tracks the major changes, rationale, and prompt/action log for Lab 2.

---

## 1. User: Requested architecture documentation and detailed flow
**Action:** Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` with:
- High-level overview of the application's layered architecture and flow
- Mermaid diagram for process visualization
- Layer-by-layer breakdown with code examples, struct/function references, and processing logic

## 2. User: Requested grep-based search for loops and match statements
**Action:** Searched all `src/*.rs` files for loops and match statements; described their role in processing and control flow in the architecture documentation.

## 3. User: Requested detailed layered summary with code examples
**Action:** Added section to `ARCHITECTURE.md` elaborating each architectural layer, including key structs, functions, and data types passed between layers.

## 4. User: Requested ASCII UML diagrams of architecture
**Action:** Appended two ASCII UML diagrams to `ARCHITECTURE.md`: a simple stacked-layer diagram and a detailed version with bullet points for each layer.

## 5. User: README and .gitignore updates
**Action:** Updated `README.md` to reference `ARCHITECTURE.md` for details. Added `.DS_Store` to `.gitignore`.

## 6. User: Lab logging and authorship
**Action:** Added authorship section to `ARCHITECTURE.md` and created this `Lab2.md` to log today's changes.


## 7. User: Output Tenengrad sharpness as an additional detail
**Action:** Modified `main.rs` so that Tenengrad sharpness is computed and included in the output for each image, both in verbose and standard output. This provides a direct sharpness metric alongside blur detection and resolves the unused function warning.

This log documents the session's major code changes, rationale, and prompt/action history for Lab 2.

### Planned Refactor: Modularizing main.rs

To improve clarity and modularity, we will refactor functions from main.rs into logically grouped modules:

- Move all test functions to `main_tests.rs`.
- Move image analysis helpers (`debug_blur_analysis`, `analyze_blur_variance`, `tenengrad_sharpness`) to `image_analysis.rs`.
- Move metadata extraction (`extract_focal_length`) to `metadata.rs`.
- Optionally move the processing pipeline (`process_image`) to `processing.rs` if main.rs remains large.

### Refactor Steps Completed on 2025-07-24

- Moved all test functions from `main.rs` to `main_tests.rs`.
- Moved image analysis helpers (`debug_blur_analysis`, `analyze_blur_variance`, `tenengrad_sharpness`) to `image_analysis.rs`.
- Moved metadata extraction (`extract_focal_length`) to `metadata.rs`.
- Updated imports and module declarations in `main.rs` to use the new modules.
- Fixed all resulting syntax errors and lints from the function moves.
- Confirmed the codebase is now modular and matches the layered architecture plan.

This will align the codebase with the layered architecture described in ARCHITECTURE.md and improve maintainability.

## Modularization: lib.rs and main.rs (2025-07-24)

- **Created `lib.rs`**: Added a new `lib.rs` as the project library root, re-exporting core modules and preparing for logic extraction.
- **Moved `process_image` to `lib.rs`**: Extracted the main image processing logic from `main.rs` into `lib.rs` as a public function for reuse and modularity.
- **Updated `main.rs`**: Refactored `main.rs` to import and use `process_image` from `lib.rs`, removing the local definition and making `main.rs` a thin binary interface.

These steps enforce modularity, improve maintainability, and follow best practices for Rust projects that provide both a binary and a library interface.
