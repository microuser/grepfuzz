# Lab 2: Architecture Documentation and Enhancements Log

**Date:** 2025-07-24

This document tracks the major changes, rationale, and prompt/action log for Lab 2.

---

## 1. User: Requested architecture documentation and detailed flow
**Action:** Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` with:
- High-level overview of the application's layered architecture and flow
- Mermaid diagram for process visualization
- Layer-by-layer breakdown with code examples, struct/function references, and processing logic

## 2. User: Requested grep-based search for loops and match statements
**Action:** Searched all `src/*.rs` files for loops and match statements; described their role in processing and control flow in the architecture documentation.

## 3. User: Requested detailed layered summary with code examples
**Action:** Added section to `ARCHITECTURE.md` elaborating each architectural layer, including key structs, functions, and data types passed between layers.

## 4. User: Requested ASCII UML diagrams of architecture
**Action:** Appended two ASCII UML diagrams to `ARCHITECTURE.md`: a simple stacked-layer diagram and a detailed version with bullet points for each layer.

## 5. User: README and .gitignore updates
**Action:** Updated `README.md` to reference `ARCHITECTURE.md` for details. Added `.DS_Store` to `.gitignore`.

## 6. User: Lab logging and authorship
**Action:** Added authorship section to `ARCHITECTURE.md` and created this `Lab2.md` to log today's changes.
