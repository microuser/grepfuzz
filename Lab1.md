# Lab1.md

## Summary of Changes (Session Log)

### 1. EXIF Crate Replacement
- Replaced the `exif` crate with `rexif` for extracting EXIF metadata, due to versioning and compatibility issues.
- Refactored `extract_focal_length` to use `rexif`'s API.

### 2. CLI Improvements
- Added `-f/--file` argument for specifying a file to check for blurriness.
- Improved help output and logic: prints help if no stdin or arguments are provided.
- Updated help text to describe all options.

### 3. Debug Mode
- Implemented `--debug` mode that generates and analyzes synthetic images (static noise and pure white) and prints detailed step-by-step blur analysis.
- Added support for configuring blur threshold via a `grepfuzz.toml` config file.
- Added the `rand` crate as a dependency for synthetic image generation.
- Removed the `config` crate and all config file support for threshold (now CLI-only).

### 4. Unit Testing
- Added a unit test for a 100x100 solid white image to ensure it is classified as blurry (variance near zero).
- Added a unit test for a 100x100 checkerboard pattern to ensure it is classified as sharp.
- Added a unit test for a 100x100 checkerboard with 10x10 blocks to ensure lower-frequency sharpness is detected.

### 5. Code Cleanups and CLI Improvements
- Removed unused imports, variables, and fixed all warnings except those intentionally ignored.
- CLI threshold (`-t <threshold>`) is now the only way to configure blur detection.
- All config file references have been removed.
- All tests now pass (with warnings).
